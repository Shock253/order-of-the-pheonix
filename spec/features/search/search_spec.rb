# As a user,
# When I visit '/'
# And I Select “Gryffindor” from the select field
# (Note: Use the existing select field)
# And I click 'Search For Members“
# Then I should be on page “/search”
# Then I should see the total number of the order of the phoenix members that belong to Gryffindor. (i.e. 21)
# And I should see a list with the detailed information for the 21 members of the Order of the Phoenix for house Gryffindor.
#
# And for each of the members I should see:
# - The name of the member
# - The members role (if it exists)
# - The house the member belongs to
# - The Patronus of the member (if it exists)
